# Sustainability Metrics Explorer

## About

> [!NOTE]
> This project is early in development. The framework, metrics, and analyses are all preliminary.
 
The Sustainability Metrics project is a collaborative effort to measure food system sustainability in New England led by the University of Vermont (UVM) Food Systems Research Center (FSRC). We work with five teams of investigators conducting primary research in vital aspects of local and regional food systems. To support this work, we are also exploring secondary data sources. 

This repository houses an R Shiny Dashboard app that allows for interactive exploration of metrics and spatial data. It follows the [golem](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem/tree/master) framework for Shiny app development. You can [find the app here](https://chris-donovan.shinyapps.io/SMexplorer/).
